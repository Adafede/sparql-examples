# SPARQL examples

> **This repository has moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/adafede/sparql-examples).**
> This mirror is no longer maintained.

This is a collection of SPARQL examples usable on different SIB related SPARQL endpoints or datasets. The examples are stored one query per file in project specific repositories in the [examples](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples/tree/master/examples) folder.

Each SPARQL query is itself in a turtle file. We use the following ontologies for the basic concepts.

* ShACL for the relation to the text of the Select/Ask queries, and declaring prefixes
* RDFS for comments and labels as shown in the user interfaces, annotated with a language tag
* RDF for basic type relations
* schema.org for the target SPARQL endpoint and tagging relevant keywords

## Artifact generation and quality assurance

We use the [SIB SPARQL Examples utils](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples-utils/) for testing and generating artifacts.

First, download the jar file with:

```bash
wget -O sparql-examples-utils.jar 'https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples-utils/releases/download/v2.0.19/sparql-examples-utils-2.0.19-uber.jar'
```

### Compile all query files into one file to upload to your endpoint

Compile all query files for a specific example folder, into a local file including the prefixes/namespaces definitions:

```bash
java -jar sparql-examples-utils.jar convert -i examples/ -p Wikidata -f ttl > examples_Wikidata.ttl
```

> You can then load this file to this project SPARQL endpoint! We recommend to upload it to a named graph: your endpoint URL + `/.well-known/sparql-examples`

Or compile for all example folders, as JSON-LD, to the standard output:

```bash
java -jar sparql-examples-utils.jar convert -i examples/ -p all -f jsonld
```

### Generate RQ files

For easier use by other tools we can also generate [rq](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#mediaType) files. Following the syntax of [grlc](https://grlc.io/) allowing to use these queries as APIs.
```bash
java -jar sparql-examples-utils.jar convert -i examples/ -p all -r
```

### Generate markdown file

Generate markdown files with the query and a mermaid diagram of the queries, to be used to deploy a static website for the query examples.

```bash
java -jar sparql-examples-utils.jar convert -i examples/ -m
```

### Testing the queries

The queries are parsed and validated but not executed with junit using the Tester

```bash
java -jar sparql-examples-utils.jar test --input-directory=./examples
```

should return no test failures. RDF4j and Jena are both a lot stricter than virtuoso.

The queries can be executed automatically on all endpoints they apply to using an extra argument `--also-run-slow-tests`:

```bash
java -jar sparql-examples-utils.jar test --input-directory=./examples/Wikidata --also-run-slow-tests
```

> This does change the queries to add a LIMIT 1 if no limit was set in the query. Then check if there is a result it is fetched.

## Querying for queries

As the SPARQL examples are themselves RDF, they can be queried for as soon as they are loaded in a SPARQL endpoint.
```sparql
PREFIX sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX spex: <https://purl.expasy.org/sparql-examples/ontology#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?sq ?comment ?query
WHERE {
    ?sq a sh:SPARQLExecutable ;
        rdfs:comment ?comment ;
        sh:select|sh:ask|sh:construct|spex:describe ?query .
} ORDER BY ?sq
```

## Finding queries that run on more than one endpoint

This expects the Jena tools to be available in your $PATH. e.g. `export PATH="$JENA_HOME/bin:$PATH"`

```bash
java -jar sparql-examples-utils.jar convert -i examples/ -p all -f ttl > examples_all.ttl

sparql --data examples_all.ttl "SELECT ?query (GROUP_CONCAT(?target ; separator=', ') AS ?targets) WHERE { ?query <https://schema.org/target> ?target } GROUP BY ?query HAVING (COUNT(DISTINCT ?target) > 1) "
```

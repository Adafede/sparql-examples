# SPARQL examples

This repository provides a collection of SPARQL query examples in various formats, tailored for different projects with publicly available SPARQL endpoints.

We continuously expand this collection to highlight diverse use cases, including:

* [Chemicals](./examples/Chemicals/index.html)
* [Maintenance](./examples/Maintenance/index.html)
* [Omics](./examples/Omics/index.html)
* [Scholarly](./examples/Scholarly/index.html)
	* [Articles](./examples/Scholarly/Articles/index.html)
	* [Authors](./examples/Scholarly/Authors/index.html)
* [Taxa](./examples/Taxa/)
* [Varia](./examples/Varia/index.html)

Overall statistics are available under [algebra-statistics](./examples/algebra-statistics.html).

This repository is based on the work by the [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/),
and specifically [this repository](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples).

Output should include the corresponding SwissLipids ID(s) and name(s), and the name(s) and ID(s) of the organisms.
￼This query first identifies SwissLipids identifiers for a given list of NCBI taxonomic IDs. It then retrieves the corresponding Isomeric subspecies and returns those that are linked to at least one PMID. As that PMID does not necessarily reflect association to the cellular compartment in question we don’t return that.

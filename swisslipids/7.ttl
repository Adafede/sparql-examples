This question would allow a user with (a list of) very high level MS identifications to immediately narrow them to the most likely potential lipid structures and protein targets as in this example: SLM:000056871 / PC(O-36:4) (target species of interest) -> SLM:000028143 / PC(O-16:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) -> LPCAT4, PLA2G4A, PLA2G4C, PLA2G4F (target proteins)"""^^rdf:HTML ;

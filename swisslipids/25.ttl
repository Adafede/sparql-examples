￼Output should include the corresponding SwissLipids ID(s) and name(s), and the name(s) and ID(s) of the cellular components. 
This query first identifies SwissLipids identifiers for a given list of GO cellular component identifiers. It then retrieves the corresponding Isomeric subspecies and returns those that are linked to at least one PMID. As that PMID does not necessarily reflect association to the cellular compartment in question we don’t return that.

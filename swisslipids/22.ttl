    rdfs:comment """￼Returns the list of possible lipid structures for a list of tissues (UBERON lipid identifiers), but considers only those lipids associated with one or more publications.
Output should include the corresponding SwissLipids ID(s) and name(s), and the name(s) and ID(s) of the tissues. 
This query first retrieves SwissLipids identifiers for a given list of UBERON identifiers. It then retrieves the corresponding Isomeric subspecies and returns those that are linked to at least one PMID. As that PMID does not necessarily reflect association to the tissue in question we don’t return that.
